# benefits-app

#### #In Progress#

This app is created to view a summary of an employee's total benefits cost per year. The assumption is made that an employee's benefits cost $1000 and any dependents they have cost $500.
Employees as well as their dependents can be entered into the application and the total cost of their benefits per year before and after discounts will be displayed on the page in table form.

This app was created using React, C# and an SQL database.
